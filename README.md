## Running the Project

This project uses Java's `assert` statement, so you need to enable assertions when running the project. If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:

1. Go to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations...`
2. In the `Configuration` tab, find the `VM options` field.
3. Enter `-ea` in the `VM options` field.
4. Click `Apply` and then `OK`.

Now, when you run the project, assertions will be enabled.
