The runtime contains the state of the model checker during the execution implemented as a singleton class `RuntimeEnvironment`. Calls to the runtime are inserted by the [[Byte code Modifier]] when instrumented and modifying the byte code. These calls, mutate the state of the runtime. Internally, the runtime forwards these calls to the [[Scheduler]] which decides the schedule of the threads and controls the interleaving.

Calls to the runtime are invoked by the instrumented code within the context of a `Thread`. The calls are made at points of a `Thread`'s execution where it could possibly interleave with other threads. Consider the canonical example of shared mutexes. Two threads synchronize using a single mutex that wraps a shared variable. Each thread should acquire the mutex lock before accessing or modifying the shared variable. In this scenario, both threads invoke the runtime when trying to acquire or release the mutex lock. Other such instances include semaphore, monitors, message passing primitives, etc. 

Below, we list all the operations where the runtime is invoked,

The semantics of each operation involves interacting with the scheduler, updating the execution graph with events. In general each operation creates an event to be added to the execution graph and subsequently (based on the [[Scheduler]]), either 
1. Returns the control to the thread
2. Or waits until the scheduler resumes this operation

However, as already encountered, certain operations are deliberately blocking and non-blocking. Meaning, the operation will by default execute (Step 1)
